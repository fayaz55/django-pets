# Learning Django - Pet Adoption App
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Learning Django. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-django-2).
In this project I developed an pet adoption app which lists the pets available and the information on each pet.

## Instructions

Download repository and navigate to `django-pets-master/wisdompets`

Run the following commands: 

`python manage.py migrate`

`python manage.py load_pet_data` 

`python manage.py runserver`

Go on a web browser and type in `localhost:8000` to see the web app
